# Module Project: Portfolio Generator
In this module, you’ll use Node.js to build a program that creates an HTML portfolio page, and you’ll do it without ever touching an HTML file! Instead, you’ll use the command line to capture user input and place it in a JavaScript function that provides the finished HTML page as output.
